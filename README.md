# Cordova Spotify SDK Plugin

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/Festify/cordova-spotify.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

An [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) plugin providing access to the Spotify SDK for iOS and Android.

[API documentation](https://festify.github.io/cordova-spotify/)

## Features

This plugin provides a very simple and atomic layer over playback functionality of the Spotify SDK. It allows you to play Spotify tracks via their URI. Metadata and authentication functionality has deliberately been left out in favor of the [Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) and our Spotify OAuth 2 plugin [cordova-spotify-oauth](https://github.com/Festify/cordova-spotify-oauth).

## Installation

```bash
cordova plugin add cordova-spotify
```

Note: Make sure your installation path doesn't contain any spaces.
